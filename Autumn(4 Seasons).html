<a href="index.html">Back to the Main Site</a>
<p>Autumn or Fall as it is called is the last season of the year. The fall equinox in September marks the first day of autumn. It is the transitional season from summer to winter. In autumn you will expect some leaves of plants to change color and for the temperature to drop and for it to get colder.</p>
